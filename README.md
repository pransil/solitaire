# Solitaire

The purpose of this project was to test the Cursor.ai coding tool to understand what it is capable of. I am quite impressed. It is much more capable than when I last used it, 6 months ago.

A simple web-based Solitaire game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Click cards to move them according to Solitaire rules.
- Click "New Game" to start over.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `style.css` — Game styling
- `main.js` — Game logic
